## SHOOT OR DIE
Shoot or Die is an arcade-style 2D shooter game developed using Pygame. In this game, you control a plane to avoid enemy missiles and shoot them down before they hit you. Your health decreases if you are hit by enemies, and your goal is to survive as long as possible.

## GAMEPLAY
The game starts with a menu screen. Press SPACE to start the game.
Control a plane that shoots bullets to destroy incoming enemy missiles.
The game features a health bar, and each time an enemy hits your plane, you lose health.
The game ends when your health reaches zero, at which point you return to the start menu.


## CONTROLS
W: Move the plane up.
S: Move the plane down.
SPACE: Shoot bullets.
ESC: Quit the game.

The health bar is displayed on the top-left of the screen and decreases as your plane gets hit.
The game has a simple wave-based enemy spawn system, increasing the challenge over time.
Enjoy the game!
